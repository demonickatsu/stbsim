a website that emulates the look of the pre-X1 Comcast cable boxes (and some other providers' older interfaces.)

still very much a **work in progress** and will eventually play IPTV streams (with EPG support), but only plays MP4 files right now

tools used:

http://selfcss.org/ for making the CSS

https://getpaint.net/ for making the menu bar's background

https://code.visualstudio.com/ for code editing

https://youtube.com/@TVsFenwick/ as a reference
